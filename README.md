This is a personal website i built to talk more about myself and possibly have more fun with UI designing. 
It is built with purely CSS, HTML and just a tad bit of JavaScript (that was mainly only for the tooltip)
All poster images on the homepage are photographs I took of decor from my own room. 
These posters were purchased from Temu and were sold without artist attribution. 
If any artist is identifiable and wants credit added or the work removed, I’m happy to update the site.
